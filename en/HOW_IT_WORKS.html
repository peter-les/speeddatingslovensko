<h1>What is speed dating?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Speed dating are dating evenings where you meet in person all participants of the opposite gender who attend the event.</li>
<li>Currently, we usually have 4 to 8 people of the opposite gender at our events.</li>
<li>After a short personal conversation in pairs, you must decide if you want to meet this person again in the future.</li>
<li>If yes, write it on paper, and in case of a mutual match, the moderator will send both of you the contacts after the event so you can continue meeting independently.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How does it work with us?</h1>

<ul>
<li>At the beginning, the moderator/organizer will greet you and ask for your first name.<br>
(In case of multiple matches, also your surname)</li>
<li>You will receive a paper with your first name, which you carry with you throughout the evening.<br>
(Bring your own paper for notes you want to take home)</li>
<li>Pens are prepared at eight tables.</li>
<li>Women sit at the tables and men sit opposite them.</li>
<li>After 6 minutes, a bell rings and men move one seat to the next table.</li>
<li>You have 6 minutes to decide whether you want to meet this person again in the future.</li>
<li>Write the names of the people you want to meet again on the paper.</li>
<li>The moderator will collect all papers at the end of the evening.</li>
<li>After the event, if there is a mutual match, the moderator will send the contacts to both parties.</li>
</ul>
